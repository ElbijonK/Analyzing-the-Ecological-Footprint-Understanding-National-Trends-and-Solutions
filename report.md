## **1. Introduction**  

For the past few years, the concern over sustainability has led to increasing discussions between human consumption and the Earth’s ability to regenerate resources. The ecological footprint is among the most distinguishing indicators for calculating the pressure of human beings, communities, or countries on nature. It calculates the amount of biologically productive land and sea area is required to support a population’s consumption of food, energy, and materials, as well as to absorb its waste, particularly carbon emissions. In short, if the ecological footprint of a country exceeds its biocapacity, the ecosystem's ability to regenerate resources and absorb waste, then that country is considered to have an ecological deficit. That implies that a given country under an ecological deficit is relying on imports, resource depletion and environmental degradation to sustain its consumption habits

Of course, there are exceptions, even though very few of them, where the biocapacity exceeds the ecological footprint. That phenomenon is called Ecological-Reserve and it means mathematically, that a country remains within its sustainable limit. Those countries that experience a surplus of biocapacity do so due to lower levels of consumption, effective resource management, sustainable policies, or vast natural reserves relative to their overall population. Examining such study cases can provide useful information, meaningful correlations and in the end valuable lesions for sustainable development and global environmental policies.

The goal of this study is to explore factors influencing a nation’s ecological footprint and afterward explore the potential strategies individuals and governments can adopt to reduce environmental impact on their country. More specifically, this study will look into whether shifts in consumption patterns, green technology breakthroughs, changes in economic policies, GDP growth, and population management, can help countries achieve their environmental goals. By analyzing real-world examples and existing literature, this report shall provide insights into how economies can stimulate growth with environmental consideration.

The relevance of this topic is out of the question, as climate change, deforestation, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gases, and resource depletion are still on the rise, potentially endangering our world. Understanding the drivers of ecological footprint and identifying feasible solutions is essential for policymakers, businesses, and people in general, in order to create a sustainable future.

The research questions are centered around demographic changes, government policies and sustainability measures, regarding ecological footprint. After analyzing impact a third question occurs, looking into the possibility of an industrialized nation reducing its footprint despite economic growth.

## **2. Theoretical Framework**  
When it comes to environmental sciences, sustainability and ecological footprint are critical areas of study. Further brunches of environmental studies contain economics or policy-making. This section highgilights the most relevant academic theories, concepts and models underlying the study of ecological footprint and ecological sustainability, mainly emphasizing on the measurement of human impact on the environment and strategies for mitigating the current influence

The ecological footprint is a widely recognized measure that calculates the amount of biologically productive land and water required to support human activities. Developed by Wackernagel and Rees, this metric serves as a key tool in sustainability studies by comparing the demand on nature with the planet’s ability to regenerate resources, commonly known as biocapacity. When the ecological footprint surpasses biocapacity, it results in an ecological deficit, which shows unsustainable use of resources.[1] (Wackernagel & Rees, 1998)

Finally to get a meaningful comparison after analazying the ecological footprint and the environmental impact using the theories above, it is vital that a threshold exists to determine boundaries. More specifically, the Planetary Boundaries Frameowork, proposed by Rockström et al. in 2009, intentifies nine imporant environmental processses controlling Earth’s stability. This is a useful approach to get further insight. Even though a mathematical way by comparing the footprint and biocapacity of a country already exists, it is important to know the relevance of the value. The boundaries needed to gain perspective on surpluses and deficits are as follows: climate change, biodiversity loss, biogeochemical flows, freshwater use, ocean acidification. stratospheric ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosol loading and novel entities. If one of these thresholds is exceeded, there is a danger for irreversible ecological changes, leading to ecosystem collapse and climate instability.

To summarize the approach of this framework, the ecological footprint is used as a basis to measure impact, followed by the IPAT equation that analyzes human factors in environmental changes and the Planatery Boundaries Framework that serves a red line not to be crossed.

## **3. Methodology**  
  Our study primarily takes a quantitative research approach, as we were interested in comparing different countries based on various factors and analyzing how these aspects shape the world around us. The National Footprint Account dataset provides a broad perspective on these issues, making it suitable for large-scale analysis on a global level.


### **3.1 Data Collection**  
   The dataset that we used mainly for our Study is titled „NFA 2018.csv and it shows the Footprint and usage of Land in each Country from the year 1961 till 2014 and it contains 87,020 records, which include environmental and economic indicators. The dataset is structured with the following key columns, the geographical data which are very simple and include the name of each country and with their respective ISO alpha-3 Code. The dataset also includes the UN region and subregion, so it enables us to analyse the indicators on national and continental level and compare them with each other. Another Key Column is as mentioned the temporal data which include the year of the year from the year 1961 till the year 2014, so that we can analyse the development over the years and compare these with historical events or policies that were implemented throughout the years. The next important key column is the indicator type, the record column categorizes the data into environmental footprint indicators, which provide insights into capacity and consumption patterns of countries. These are the following indicators The Biocapacity indicators are Biocapcity per Capita which represents the available biologically productive land and sea per person in a country and the  Total biocapacity in global hectares indicates the total amount of ecological capacity of a country. These classifications of per Capita and total amount of hectares are the same for the rest of the indicators such as the Ecological Footprint Consumption(EFCons), the Trade related Footprints and the Ecological Footprint Production. We can interpret the indicators as follows: biocapacity (Biocap) represents the available ecological resources, while ecological footprint (EF) represents the demand placed on those resources. Consumption indicators (EFCons) show how much nature a country uses relative to what it provides. Trade indicators (EFExports, EFImports) help to assess whether a country is an ecological creditor (exporting resources) or debtor (importing resources). Because of  this we can deduce if a country is over consuming or if the country is within their capacity. The dataset gets more specific in the use of the biologically
 productive land and sea. So the next key column is the use of land, which describes the land use such as crop-, grazing and forest land and also the use of the sea such as fishing grounds. Another key columns are the Per capita GDP and the population. These indicators help us understand how the countries are exactly using their biological land usage and how this correlates with the GDP and the population development. The source of the dataset is the online platform Kaggle where many people can provide data sience and machine learning, so that people can cooperate and discuss the dataset, machine learning and data analysis.  (Global Footprint Network. National Footprint Accounts 2018. Kaggle, 2018. Accessed March 8, 2025. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/footprintnetwork/national-footprint-accounts-2018.).
 
 Before conducting the analysis, data preprocessing was necessary. Some columns, such as the ISO alpha-3 code, land-use categories, and per capita GDP, contained missing values, which could have affected later visualizations. Since the proportion of missing data was relatively small and would not significantly impact the study or its visualizations, we opted to remove rows with missing values rather than impute them. Additionally, some rows contained inconsistencies, requiring data cleaning and filtering. While most of the dataset consists of numerical data, it also includes categorical variables that need to be correctly processed to facilitate efficient programming and ensure logical consistency in data interpretation.


### **3.2 Data Analysis Methods**  
For the Data Analysis we wrote and used code to extract the Data from our chosen Dataset and format it into Graphs depicting the National Footprint and other statistics of Countries we deemed interesting. This would include countries from the EU like Germany and France for their partaking in significant global climate movements. For this we would look at which sustainability measures and climate movements took place and take into consideration and talk about their effectiveness in terms of affecting a country's Ecological Footprint by comparing these findings with the trend of the Graphs. Developing Countries with a rapid increase in population to highlight the significance of the population size for the national footprint. Countries like Brazil were taken as an example for this since you can see a correlation between these two factors. Another factor would be a country's GDP where we look at Lebanon for example. This will be gone over in more detail in the findings section.
We used the application Streamlit to create a interactive web-based dashboard  that uses the National Footprint Account 2018 dataset and their columns to create different graphs for Ecological Footprint Consumption, Biocapacity Over Time, National Footprint Over Time, GDP per Capita and the Population Development for one or multiple countries so that the user can compare different countries with each other. We also added a slider for the entire time span that the dataset consist of, so that the users can look at certain time frames and pin point them to compare them with the policies through out the years. We used the following libraries:
Streamlit to create the interactive dashboard and used the functions like st.set_page_config() to configure the page title, the icon that is showcased and the layout of the page. st.set_page_config(page_title="NFA Dataset", page_icon="🌍", layout="wide"), we choose the layout to be wide, because it would look better for the visualization. We then added  st.title(), st.subheader(), st.write() functions to add headings, descriptions and explanations to create a more user friendly website that explains the purpose of the dashboard. We added also icons again to make it more aesthetically, st.title("🌍 National Footprint Accounts (NFA) Dataset")
st.subheader("📊 About the Data Columns"). For the interactive selection inputs we used the functions st.multiselect(),it enables us to select multiple countries, st.slider(),to create the time slider so the user can select their time frame that they choose, st.checkbox() is for the option to show the raw data on the website. The options were defined as following
graph_options = ["EF Consumption", "Biocapacity Over Time", "National Footprint Over Time", "GDP per Capita", "Population Development"]
selected_graphs = st.multiselect("Select Graphs to Display", graph_options, default=graph_options).
We then added the code to allow to user to filter  specific countries and a time range:
selected_countries= st.multiselect("Select Country/Countries", df['country'].dropna().unique().tolist(), default=[])
years = st.slider("Select Year Range", int(df.year.min()), int(df.year.max()), (2000, 2016))
df_filtered = df[(df["country"].isin(selected_countries)) & (df["year"].between(years[0], years[1]))].
Another important library is the pandas library which is used to handle and process tabular data. The essential functions that we used were the pd.read_csv() function which reads the dataset from a CSV file  and then we used df.pivot() function to reshape the dataset, so that we can work with the dataset for visualizations. In this case we extracted the GDP per Capita and the population before pivoting. The data was then pivoted so that each row represents a country and a year, with different ecological measures as columns. When we were done with  the pivoting we then merged the GDP per Capita and the Population data back into the main dataset with the function df.merge().
df_gdp_pop = df_filtered[["year", "country", "Percapita GDP (2010 USD)", "population"]].drop_duplicates()
df_pivot = df_filtered.pivot(index=["year", "country"], columns="record", values="total").fillna(0).reset_index()
df_pivot = df_pivot.merge(df_gdp_pop, on=["year", "country"], how="left").fillna(0)
df_gdp_pop = df_filtered[["year", "country", "Percapita GDP (2010 USD)", "population"]].drop_duplicates()
df_pivot = df_filtered.pivot(index=["year", "country"], columns="record", values="total").fillna(0).reset_index()
df_pivot = df_pivot.merge(df_gdp_pop, on=["year", "country"], how="left").fillna(0) .
 
For the Ecological Footprint Consumption we used the Formula that was already given on Kaggle with the dataset: „EFConsumption​=EFProduction​+EFImports​−EFExports​“ (Global Footprint Network. (2018). National Footprint Accounts 2018 [Dataset]. Kaggle. Retrieved March 8, 2025, from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/footprintnetwork/national-footprint-accounts-2018).
With this formula we calculated the Ecological Footprint Consumption in the code using python.
if all(col in df_pivot.columns for col in ["EFProdTotGHA", "EFImportsTotGHA", "EFExportsTotGHA"]):
	df_pivot["EF Consumption"] = df_pivot["EFProdTotGHA"] + df_pivot["EFImportsTotGHA"] - df_pivot["EFExportsTotGHA"].
The last library that we used was altair for the data visualization, the functions were alt.Chart().mark_line( to  create a line chart and then we used the function encode(x, y, color) to define the x-axis, y- axis and the colour for encoding the graph. We then created a dictionary to were we match the selected graph names maps to their corresponding dataset column.
graph_mappings = {
	"EF Consumption": "EF Consumption",
	"Biocapacity Over Time": "BiocapTotGHA",
	"National Footprint Over Time": "EFConsTotGHA",
	"GDP per Capita": "Percapita GDP (2010 USD)",
	"Population Development": "population"
}.
Then we wrote the code to  generate the graphs and then display them on dashboard.
for graph_name in selected_graphs:
	column_name = graph_mappings.get(graph_name)
	if column_name in df_pivot.columns and df_pivot[column_name].sum() > 0:
    	st.subheader(graph_name)
    	chart = alt.Chart(df_pivot).mark_line().encode(
        	x=alt.X("year:N", title="Year"),
            y=alt.Y(f"{column_name}:Q", title=graph_name),
        	color="country:N"
    	).properties(height=320)
    	st.altair_chart(chart, use_container_width=True) else:
    	st.warning(f"No data available for {graph_name}. Please check your selections.")



### **3.3 Limitations**  
The Dataset itself is very useful for finding correlations between different statistics like Population and National Footprint. For the interpretation of the Graphs further research is needed to explain the reason for the sudden shifts of each trend. And for a lot of Data it is important to compare between two countries for a point of reference which was possible with the Data Set.

## **4. Findings**  
The cases of Brazil and Germany serve as a prime example of how demographic changes influence the trend of national footprints. It may be assumed that Germany, as a more industrially advanced country, would have a higher national footprint. While this was initially true, an interesting development can be observed in the national footprints of these two countries over the past 60 years. The following analysis examines a graph depicting the ecological footprint in global hectares (GHA) per year.


At first glance, the graph indicates that Brazil’s national footprint surpasses Germany’s in the mid-1990s. A closer examination of the factors influencing this trend provides insight into the reasons behind this shift. Initially, Germany had a higher national footprint, which increased rapidly and peaked in the late 1970s before stabilizing and subsequently declining. Brazil’s national footprint also increased but remained below Germany’s until the mid-1990s, after which it continued to rise while Germany’s declined.
Germany’s National Footprint Trend (1960s–1970s)
The rapid growth in Germany’s national footprint during the 1960s can be attributed to the post-war economic boom, known as the Wirtschaftswunder. This period was characterized by industrial expansion and urbanization, leading to a 58% increase in living standards. Sectors such as steel, chemicals, and manufacturing expanded rapidly, resulting in higher energy consumption and raw material use. At the time, energy production relied heavily on fossil fuels, particularly coal and oil, further exacerbating environmental impact.
Additionally, the expansion of private vehicle ownership played a crucial role in this increase. Car prices declined by up to 20%, making automobiles more accessible and further driving fossil fuel consumption. The post-war construction boom also contributed significantly to the rise in Germany’s national footprint, as infrastructure development demanded extensive resource extraction and energy use.
Agricultural intensification further amplified the footprint, as efforts to meet the food demands of a growing population led to increased land use, deforestation, and reliance on chemical inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. These factors combined to drive an unregulated increase in Germany’s national footprint until the 1970s, when environmental awareness began to grow.

Stabilization and Decline of Germany’s National Footprint (1970s–Present)
The rise in environmental consciousness during the 1970s is reflected in the implementation of various environmental policies. A correlation can be observed between the introduction of these policies and subsequent changes in Germany’s national footprint.
The Clean Air Act (1974) aimed to mitigate air pollution and protect ecosystems. The graph indicates a reversal in the national footprint trend following the enactment of this policy (United States, 2023). Shortly thereafter, the Federal Nature Conservation Act (1976) was introduced, focusing on ecosystem preservation and biodiversity protection, which likely contributed to the continued decline in Germany’s ecological footprint (Federal Nature Conservation Act, 2009).
The 1980s marked a significant period for environmental policy in Germany. In 1980, the country initiated its Energiewende (energy transition), an ambitious strategy to shift towards renewable energy sources (Germany’s Energiewende in Brief, 2024). This transition led to increased reliance on solar, wind, and biomass energy, reducing dependence on coal and nuclear power. The introduction of the Renewable Energy Act (EEG, 2000) further reinforced this shift by implementing feed-in tariffs to incentivize renewable energy production (BMWK - Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, n.d.-b).
Political developments also played a role in shaping Germany’s environmental policies. The rise of the Green Party (Die Grünen) in the 1980s significantly influenced the national political agenda, prompting other parties to integrate sustainability policies into their platforms (Uekötter, 2014).
In subsequent decades, Germany continued to implement measures aimed at reducing its environmental impact. Key focus areas included waste management, carbon emission reductions, improvements in public transportation, and forest protection initiatives. As a result, Germany has established itself as a leader in sustainability and climate innovation, with its declining national footprint serving as evidence of the effectiveness of these policies.

Brazil’s economic expansion and National Footprint growth
In contrast to Germany, Brazil has experienced a steady and continuous increase in its national footprint. This growth can be attributed to multiple demographic and economic factors.
Since the 1960s, Brazil’s population has surged from approximately 72.18 million to 202.76 million. This significant increase has resulted in greater resource consumption and land use. In addition to demographic expansion, Brazil has undergone substantial economic development, particularly in agriculture and industry. The expansion of these sectors has led to heightened resource extraction, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and intensified environmental strain.
One of the primary contributors to Brazil’s growing national footprint is deforestation, particularly in the Amazon rainforest. Large-scale deforestation reduces carbon absorption capacity, increases land degradation, and contributes to biodiversity loss. Additionally, forested land is frequently converted into agricultural land for activities such as cattle ranching and soybean production, further exacerbating environmental pressures (Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020, 2020).
Beyond deforestation, Brazil’s reliance on natural resource extraction, including logging, mining, and fossil fuel production, has significantly impacted its ecological footprint. Much of this resource exploitation has been driven by the global demand for industrial and agricultural exports, placing additional stress on the country’s ecosystems (Morlin et al., 2017).
Α case study on Lebanon and Madagascar
Biocapacity and ecological footprint are important indicators for understanding the sustainability of a country’s natural resources. Biocapacity represents the total biologically productive land and sea area available to produce resources and absorb waste, while the national footprint indicates the demand placed on these resources by human activities (Global Footprint Network, n.d.). This report compares the biocapacity and national footprint trends for Lebanon and Madagascar from 1960 to the 2010s, highlighting their sustainability challenges and differences.
The graph for Lebanon reveals a consistent increase in national footprint over time, surpassing biocapacity by a substantial margin. From the 1960s, Lebanon's biocapacity remained relatively low and stable, showing only slight increases. However, the national footprint exhibited a rapid and exponential growth, particularly after 1990 (WWF, 2022). This trend suggests that Lebanon has been experiencing increasing ecological deficits, where resource consumption significantly exceeds natural regeneration.
The factors contributing to Lebanon’s growing national footprint likely include urbanization, industrialization, population growth, and increased energy consumption. The huge gap between biocapacity and national footprint indicates heavy reliance on imported resources and unsustainable exploitation of local ecosystems (Wackernagel & Beyers, 2019).
Madagascar's graph presents an opposite scenario. Unlike Lebanon, Madagascar has maintained a relatively high biocapacity, which has remained stable and even had a slight growth over the decades. In contrast, although its national footprint is increasing, it is still much lower than its biocapacity, signifying an ecological surplus rather than a deficit (Global Footprint Network, n.d.).
This trend indicates that Madagascar, despite increasing human demand, still possesses biological resources to sustain its population. However, recent increases in the national footprint suggest a rising pressure on resources, likely driven by population growth, deforestation, and agricultural expansion (Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy, 2022). Nevertheless, Madagascar’s relatively high biocapacity provides a buffer against resource depletion, unlike Lebanon.
The fundamental difference between the two nations lies in their biocapacity and how it compares to their national footprint. Lebanon has consistently exhibited an ecological deficit, where consumption surpasses available resources, leading to greater reliance on imports and environmental degradation (WWF, 2022). Madagascar, on the other hand, retains an ecological surplus, allowing it to remain relatively sustainable despite growing pressures.
A possible explanation for this is the land area and ecological productivity. Madagascar, being an island nation with vast forests and agricultural land, naturally has a higher biocapacity. Lebanon, with a smaller landmass and higher urbanization rates, has limited natural resources, making it more vulnerable to ecological overshoot (Meadows, Meadows, Randers, & Behrens, 1972). Additionally, economic factors play a role, with Lebanon’s higher industrialization contributing to increased energy consumption and waste production compared to Madagascar’s largely agrarian economy.


## **5. Discussion**  
The comparative case study of Brazil and Germany illustrates the intricate dynamics of demographic change, economic growth, and environmental policy in influencing a nation’s ecological footprint. The patterns demonstrated by both nations point to the critical role of state policy industrialization trends, and environmental consciousness in either dulling or worsening environmental effect.

The research question focused on economic growth alone determining a country’s ecological footprint, has interesting results. According to the case study, the results indicate that while industrialization initially increases a country’s ecological footprint, government policies, environmental awareness, and shifts toward sustainable practices play a critical role in ensuring the issue is heavily mitigated.

In the case study of Germany it is clearly demonstrated that a nation can bounce back economically from ecological degradation. The initial rise in Germany’s footprint was driven by rapid industrialization and post-war economic expansion. The introduction of strict environmental regulations later on reduced the ecological footprint, resulting as a double win for Germany with both a growing economy and declining ecological footprint.

Conversely, Brazil’s trajectory follows a pattern often seen in emerging economies, where population growth, resource extraction, and industrial expansion contribute to an increasing ecological footprint. Unlike Germany, Brazil has a heavy reliance on deforestation and fossil fuel activities for economic growth, suggesting that without policy interventions or an economic model overhaul, the trend is likely to continue in the upcoming years.

The implication of this comparative study is that paying attention to environmental issues, the subsequent creation of policies and regulations are vital for balancing the ecological footprint and economic growth accordingly. Germany proves that economic growth does not necessarily indicate higher footprint, giving an example of how a developed country can develop further.

The analysis of Lebanon and Madagascar’s biocapacity and national footprint trends highlights the importance of resource management and sustainable development. Lebanon faces significant challenges in balancing its ecological demand with its limited biocapacity, necessitating policy interventions to reduce consumption and increase resource efficiency (Wackernagel & Beyers, 2019). In contrast, Madagascar’s relatively sustainable position offers an opportunity to implement conservation strategies to prevent future ecological deficits. Understanding these trends is crucial for developing policies that promote long-term environmental and economic sustainability in both nations.


Public perception about the ecological footprint and human impact on earth 
 

The ecological footprint is a critical measure of humanity's demand on nature, reflecting how much land and water area is required to sustain resource consumption and absorb waste. Public awareness and understanding of this concept vary significantly across different regions and demographics. This report explores the results of a quiz assessing public knowledge on ecological footprint-related topics and provides insights into societal perceptions and misconceptions.
Quiz Results and Analysis
The quiz asked participants questions about national and individual ecological footprints, the impact of fossil fuel consumption, and efforts to mitigate environmental damage. The responses indicate varying levels of understanding, with some key trends emerging:

1.	Countries with the Highest Ecological Footprints
- The United States was correctly identified as the country with the highest per capita ecological footprint, reflecting its high energy consumption and resource-intensive lifestyle.
- China was correctly identified as the country with the largest total ecological footprint, attributed to its massive population and industrial output.

2.	European Comparison
France was correctly identified as having a larger ecological footprint per capita than Italy, likely due to its higher energy consumption despite strong investments in renewable energy.

3.	Major Contributors to Ecological Footprint
- Fossil fuel consumption was the most frequently identified factor contributing to a country’s ecological footprint, underlining the global reliance on non-renewable energy.
- At an individual level, diet, particularly meat consumption and food waste, was recognized as a major contributor.

4.	Biocapacity Reserves and Carbon Footprint
Canada was accurately identified as having a biocapacity reserve due to its vast forests and low population density.
Qatar was correctly identified as the country with the highest carbon footprint per capita due to its heavy reliance on fossil fuels.

5.	High Ecological Footprints in Developed Countries
Participants largely acknowledged high energy consumption as the primary reason for developed nations having larger ecological footprints.


6.	Successful Sustainability Efforts
Sweden and Denmark were correctly recognized for their sustainability policies, including renewable energy investments and urban planning initiatives.

7.	Global Renewable Energy Production
China was identified as the leader in total renewable energy production, highlighting its rapid expansion in wind and solar power.

8.	Earth Overshoot Day
Most respondents correctly defined Earth Overshoot Day as the point when humanity’s resource consumption exceeds the planet’s ability to regenerate those resources in a year.

Societal Context and Implications
The quiz results highlight a mix of accurate knowledge and common misconceptions about the ecological footprint. While many participants recognized the impact of fossil fuels and diet on sustainability, others struggled with concepts like biocapacity and the significance of Earth Overshoot Day.
These findings emphasize the need for increased public education on ecological sustainability. Governments, educators, and environmental organizations should focus on raising awareness about the effects of resource consumption and the importance of adopting sustainable practices. Strengthening policies on renewable energy, reducing meat consumption, and promoting efficient urban planning are essential steps toward mitigating humanity’s environmental impact.

## **6. Conclusions**  
Conclusion on Public Perception on Ecological Footprint and Human Impact on Earth

Understanding the ecological footprint is crucial for fostering a more sustainable future. The quiz results suggest that while some aspects are well understood, there is room for improvement in public knowledge. By addressing gaps in awareness and encouraging responsible consumption, society can work toward reducing its footprint and protecting the planet for future generations.

Environmental and climate issues remain strongly anchored in societal awareness
The results of the new study on environmental awareness in Germany 2022 show that, even in times of multiple crises, environmental and climate issues are still deeply ingrained in societal consciousness. For example, the overwhelming majority already feels the effects of climate change and considers adaptation measures necessary.
When it comes to the most important political issues in Germany, 67% of respondents cite the state of the healthcare system, closely followed by the state of the education system with 66%. Social justice and wars and terrorism are each named by 59%. The protection of the environment and climate is very important to 57% of respondents, placing it fifth on the list of key issues. However, compared to the previous surveys in 2020 (65%) and 2018 (64%), there is a slight decline. (Umweltbundesamt, Fachbibliothek Umwelt, 2023)
